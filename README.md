Simple JSON API Helpers


## Why...?

Because I don't want to build just the same old things, and deep-diving on how haskell templates HTML is mostly irrelevant for people (like myself) who are going to use Angular.js/similar. 

So I figured I'd get to know some of these frameworks better, and see if there's one where I can write some super elegant wrapper code to make JSON apis stupidly simple.
